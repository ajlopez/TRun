# TRun

Simple Task Runner, written in C#.

Work in Progress


## Development

```
git clone git://github.com/ajlopez/TRun.git
cd TRun
```

TBD

## Usage

### Hello world

`trun.txt` file at current directory:
```
# Hello, world configuration

hello
    message "Hello, world"

default
    hello
```

Having `trun.exe` in your path, run:
```
trun
```
It executes the `default` task, that has only one subtask: `hello`

You also can run:
```
trun hello
```
to run the `hello` task.

There are predefined tasks, like `message`.

### Invoking commands

`trun.txt` file at current directory:
```
# Hello, world configuration

hello
    do
        cmd /c echo Hello, world

default
    hello
```

The predefined `do` task executes operating system commands, launching processes.
If a command process returns a non-zero return value, the task will fail.

Note: the tasks can be nested, using spaces. No tab is allowed in
configuration file.

Note: the tasks have no explicit task dependencies. You simply write them
as task at the beginning of the task.

Note: line comments starts with `#`.

## Inception

Yes, I know. Nant and other tools exist. But I want to write a simple
implementation, no XML file, no JSON, simple text with comments.
